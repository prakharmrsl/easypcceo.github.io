<p>My name is Jacob Tuwiner. I’m the owner and creator of Easy PC, a site designed to help the new guy in the computer space. Whether you want to build your first gaming PC or your first cryptocurrency mining rig, I’ve got you covered.</p>

<p>I used to be a console gamer back in the day, until I played on my friend’s gaming PC for the first time. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw Battlefield 4 in true 1080p resolution with ultra settings, 60 FPS. I also loved raiding someone’s base in Rust which is still my favorite game to this day! From that moment on I knew I had to build a gaming PC.</p>

<p><img src="/img/profile/headshot.png" alt="ME" class="circle img-right img-small" /></p>

<p>I used some of my bar mitzvah money to build my first gaming PC. I researched which components would best fit my budget and watched tons of videos on YouTube about PC building.</p>

<p>Then the day arrived. All of my parts finally came in the mail and I assembled my first PC.</p>

<p>Then I turned it on. Nothing happened.</p>

<p>I checked everything and tried again. Nothing.</p>

<p>Then I looked two more times and realized I made a novice mistake. I didn’t connect the CPU power cable!</p>

<p>I turned it on again. Bam! Everything was working properly. From that moment on I was a member of the PC gaming community.</p>

<p>Then I heard about Bitcoin, and I found it quite fascinating. I started researching cryptocurrencies and how they work and honestly I found the topic quite confusing at first. In fact, building my first gaming PC wasn’t too easy for me either.</p>

<p>I figured there were plenty of other people who were in the same situation as me, and it turns out I was right.</p>

<p>I first made the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPW6x4ZBXR06cjmf1wOS2g" target="_blank">Easy PC YouTube channel</a> and eventually this website in order to help those just starting out. Trust me, it’s a lot easier than it seems! The hardest part is getting started, and it’s all down hill from there.</p>

<h3 id="my-current-pc-specs">My Current PC Specs</h3>

<p>If you’re curious about what I’m running in my rig, I’m going to list my specs down below.</p>

<p>I don’t really feel the need to run my games in 1440p or 4K resolution. I’d rather save the money and play in 1080p with medium-high settings with 60+ FPS. That being said, here are my specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Ryzen 3 1200 Overclocked to 4.0 GHz</li>
  <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASRock AB350M</li>
  <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 2x4GB DDR4 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series</li>
  <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 240 GB SSD, 120GB SSD, 1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive</li>
  <li><strong>Graphics Card:</strong> GeForce GTX 1060 3GB</li>
  <li><strong>Case</strong>: NZXT Phantom with Blue LEDs</li>
  <li><strong>PSU:</strong> Corsair 500 Watt Power Supply</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not the most expensive build in the world, but it definitely suits my purposes well.</p>

<p>The Man? The Myth? The Legend?</p>

<p>Hey there! I’m Jordyn Hamilton, a writer and editor for Easy PC. The one-stop-shop for brand new PC builders, gamers, and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<p>I got my start in the PC community around 2017 when a good friend of mine convinced me to build a gaming computer after he’d done the same. I had always thought about getting into PC gaming since the most I’d experienced up to that point was 30fps Minecraft on my old HP laptop.</p>

<p>So the concept of running any games at a good framerate, and for a good price, was gorgeous to me. Around that time, I got a job editing for an online blog. I made around $1,400 working on it and I threw about $500 of that into my brand new PC build.</p>

<p>Mind you, I did not know anything about computers prior to this and I did not seek out any help in choosing parts (like I should have). In the end, my first build looked a little something like: FX 6300, RX 560 4GB, random $10 aftermarket CPU cooler, just to name a few hiccups.</p>

<p>That build served me well for a couple of months until I got bored with it and wanted to upgrade. What I did was sell the parts for a little less than I paid, then I used the money to buy more used parts so I could build two more computers. Then I sold those and repeated the process until I had around $1,000.</p>

<p>Fast forward to February 2018. At this point component prices were horrible but I want my PC now, so I charged in full of zeal with $1,000 to build the best I could, and that build fuels me to this day. Though, at this point, I think I’ve sunk another $100 or so into it.</p>
