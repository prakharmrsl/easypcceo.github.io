<p>Here‚Äôs the deal:</p>

<p>A lot of people want to build a gaming PC, but they think it‚Äôs too expensive.</p>

<p>The thing is, that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth‚Ä¶</p>

<p>PC gaming has never been cheaper, especially in 2020.</p>

<p>With the right approach, you can build a console killer, 300 dollar gaming PC that can run games in 1080p with ease.</p>

<p>In this guide, you‚Äôre going to learn how to do exactly that.</p>

<p>Alright, I‚Äôm going to be completely honest with you:</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt build a 300 dollar gaming PC with brand new parts ‚Äì at least, not a PC that can game in 1080p.</p>

<div class="tip">
<h4 class="info-box-header">Tip<i class="box-icon-spacing fas fa-check"></i></h4>
<p>However, if you buy used components online, you can make $300 go a long way. </p>

<p>All you need to build a 300 dollar gaming PC is a used desktop, graphics card, and if you can afford it, an SSD. </p>

<p>Really, that‚Äôs it. </p>
</div>

<p>You can get everything you need on eBay for a fraction of the price of new components.</p>

<p>The best part is, they‚Äôll run just as well as brand new (and more expensive) parts.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<p>You can build a cheap gaming PC pretty easily, even in 2020.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let‚Äôs get started!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-a-300-dollar-gaming-pc">How to Build a 300 Dollar Gaming PC</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs time for the tutorial. In this section, you‚Äôre going to learn how to build a cheap gaming PC (for less than 300 dollars) step by step.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-find-a-cheap-desktop-on-ebay">Step 1: Find a Cheap Desktop on eBay</h3>

<p>On a budget like this, you have to make your money go a long way.</p>

<p>Trying to build a good gaming PC from scratch on a budget like this is going to be next to impossible.</p>

<p>But here‚Äôs the thing:</p>

<p>You don‚Äôt have to build a gaming PC from scratch.</p>

<p>The most important component of any gaming PC is the GPU.</p>

<p>As long as you have a processor that‚Äôs fast enough to keep up with your GPU and sufficient RAM, you‚Äôre pretty much good to go. Make sure your GPU has a good memory clock speed though. More information on that <a href="/gpu-memory-clock-speed/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The secret is finding a used desktop on eBay that has (almost) everything you need.</p>

<p>Luckily, you can find a desktop on eBay that‚Äôs a few years old for around $150 (or less).</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how:</p>

<p>First, search for ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù on eBay.</p>

<p><img src="/img/300/ebay-search.png" alt="ebay search for &quot;desktop&quot;" /></p>

<p>You can use the filters in the left column to help you find the right desktop.</p>

<p>Apply the ‚Äú8GB RAM‚Äù filter, and set the maximum price to $150 for the entire thing.</p>

<p><img src="/img/300/filters.png" alt="ebay desktop search filters" /></p>

<p>Look for a desktop that has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A good <a href="/cpu/">CPU</a> (it doesn‚Äôt need to be top-of-the-line)</li>
  <li>8GB of RAM (DDR3 will do)</li>
  <li>A case that‚Äôs large enough for a dedicated GPU</li>
  <li>A good power supply</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about it this way:</p>

<p>When you buy an old desktop on eBay, you‚Äôre getting a processor, motherboard, RAM, power supply, case, and possibly even a hard drive for around $150.</p>

<p>A new processor alone would be at least $100, even if you buy a budget CPU. As you can see, the value in buying an old desktop cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example of a good find:</p>

<p><img src="/img/300/prebuilt-pc.png" alt="prebuilt pc" /></p>

<p>It has a good i5 CPU, 500GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and Windows 10, all for $135.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt forget about the case, motherboard, case fans, and power supply as well!</p>

<p>If you can, go for an i3 or even an i5 processor, even if it‚Äôs a few generations old.</p>

<p><strong>This part is important</strong>:</p>

<p>notice how the case is large enough to house an external GPU - this is crucial!</p>

<p>Some of the computers you‚Äôll find will have slim/small cases that aren‚Äôt large enough for a GPU.</p>

<p>If you want to buy another case that looks better and can fit your graphics card, you should check out the post I wrote about the <a href="/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/">smallest ATX cases</a>.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre big enough for all of your components, but the cases still aren‚Äôt overwhelmingly large. In fact, they‚Äôre perfect for beginner builders.</p>

<p>Or, if you want something smaller, check out our article about the <a href="/pc-cases/smallest-micro-atx-cases/">smallest micro atx cases</a> on the market.</p>

<p>Anyway, once you‚Äôve found a good PC on eBay, it‚Äôs time to find your graphics card.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-buy-an-external-graphics-card-gpu">Step 2: Buy an External Graphics Card (GPU)</h3>

<p>At the time of writing, you can buy a used AMD RX 570 graphics card on eBay for around $110, which is a great deal.</p>

<p>An RX 570 can easily game in 1080p, with medium to high settings in most of today‚Äôs newer titles.</p>

<p><img src="/img/300/gpu.png" alt="graphics card for 300 dollar gaming pc" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôre willing to spend a bit more ‚Äì and your prebuilt desktop has a capable CPU (Intel i3, i5, etc) then you can even go for an RX 580.</p>

<p>With an older generation i3 or i5 CPU, coupled with an RX 580, you‚Äôll be able to crush 1080p gaming, easily playing at high-ultra settings.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-install-the-graphics-card">Step 3: Install the Graphics Card</h3>

<p>Once you‚Äôve ordered your PC and graphics card, you‚Äôre going to have to install the graphics card.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not hard at all. In fact, it‚Äôs probably the easiest part of the entire PC building process.</p>

<p>You can check out <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-gpu-your-pc" target="_blank">this in-depth tutorial about installing a GPU</a> for a step-by-step walkthrough.</p>

<p>In short, here‚Äôs how you do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the side panel of your case, and remove the extension slot cover</li>
  <li>Install the graphics card in the PCI slot, and screw it in</li>
  <li>Plug in the external power cable from your power supply, if necessary</li>
  <li>Close the case</li>
</ol>

<p>It‚Äôs that simple - after that, you can connect your PC to your monitor, power it on, and start gaming!</p>

<h2 id="what-will-a-300-dollar-gaming-pc-run">What Will a 300 Dollar Gaming PC Run?</h2>

<p>This is going to vary slightly depending on the prebuilt you buy, but if you can manage to pick up a PC with 8GB of RAM and a quad-core (older generation) i3 or i5 CPU, you‚Äôre in business.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="/img/300/benchmark.png" alt="i3 4170 benchmark" />
	<figcaption><p>Above, you can see how well an older i3 CPU with an RX 570 performs in the newest Battlefield title. You could definitely find a desktop with a CPU of this caliber on eBay.<i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gpucheck.com/gpu/amd-radeon-rx-570/intel-core-i3-4160-3-60ghz/high#mainads">Source</a></i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Coupled with an RX 570 (or ideally an RX 580), you can expect to run:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PUBG on Ultra Settings: 60+ FPS</li>
  <li>Battlefield V Medium Settings: 60+ FPS</li>
  <li>Grand Theft Auto V High Settings: 60+ FPS</li>
  <li>CS:GO Very High Settings: 100+ FPS</li>
  <li>FIFA High Settings: 60+ FPS</li>
  <li>Fortnite Very High Settings: 60+ FPS</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, even 300 dollars is enough for a good 1080p gaming PC, assuming you spend your money wisely.</p>

<p>Still, even though $300 is enough for a good gaming PC, saving another $200 is enough for an awesome gaming PC.</p>

<p>Trust me, that $200 goes a long way.</p>
