<p>Thanks for confirming your subscription.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what you should expect:</p>

<p>Over the next few days, Iâ€™ll be sending you a few emails teaching you how to buy gaming PC components on the lowâ€¦ Iâ€™m talking 1/5 of the retail price.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s right - youâ€™re going to learn how I built my first gaming PC for $200, with an Intel i7 and a GTX 1080 Ti.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll be able to use the same tips when building your next rig to get some insane deals!</p>

<p>After youâ€™ve learned how to get the best bang for your PC gaming buck, Iâ€™ll send over a weekly email to share more cool stuff with you.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to keep you up to date with the latest hardware news, insane deals and flash sales, tips, tricks, and more.</p>

<p>I promise to never spam your inbox like other email marketers do. Every email I send you will be packed full of value, thatâ€™s for sure.</p>

<p>And you can unsubscribe at any time - it wonâ€™t hurt my feelings!</p>

<p>That being said, check your inbox because the first money saving tip is probably there :)</p>
