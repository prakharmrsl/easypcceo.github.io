<p>Minecraft is one of the most versatile games on the market. It‚Äôs the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587861560842000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSpnjYuaYxNOHyaNIg35xFT0WxCA" target="_blank">all-time best selling game</a> by a wide margin. The sandbox nature of the game means there‚Äôs something for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p>Builders have plenty of materials and structures to choose from, while fighters and adventurers will enjoy the various biomes and enemies to explore and combat.</p>

<p>The base (also called vanilla) version of Minecraft is great on its own, but the game‚Äôs popularity and open world style have given rise to countless mods.</p>

<p>One of the most popular and well-known mod packs on the market is <a href="https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/tekkitmain.552547" target="_blank">Tekkit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-tekkit">About Tekkit</h2>

<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="Tekkit" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/tekkit.png" /></p>

<p>Tekkit is a collection of mods that introduce a huge variety of new elements, items, and machines to the game. This pack has a major focus on industrialization and machine upgrading, but includes many other features.</p>

<p>New weapons, power armor, bigger chests, computers, pocket dimensions, and a whole solar system to explore are just some of the features added by Tekkit.</p>

<p>There are just over 60 mods included in the pack, which means hours of content to explore. While it might sound like a complicated endeavour to install them all manually, there‚Äôs an easy solution.</p>

<p>The Tekkit mod pack is available on the Technic Platform, a specialized Minecraft launcher. Once you have the Technic Launcher installed, you can download Tekkit or a number of other modpacks directly and play from the launcher.</p>

<p>This easy installation and set-up means it‚Äôs very simple to switch from vanilla Minecraft to a modded version.</p>

<p>Of course, just like regular Minecraft, Tekkit is best played with others. To do that, you‚Äôll need a server.</p>

<h2 id="tekkit-tekkit-lite-tekkit-classic-and-technic">Tekkit, Tekkit Lite, Tekkit Classic, and Technic</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôve been playing Minecraft a while, but are new to the modding scene, you may find a major source of confusion in the names of the mods and launcher.</p>

<p><img class="lazyload" alt="Technic Launcher" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/technic.jpg" /></p>

<p>The Technic Launcher is software downloaded prior to any mods. This launcher allows you to download a whole mod pack at a time automatically. This saves you from having to download and install each mod manually as well as adjusting mod loading orders.</p>

<p>Within the Technic Launcher you can download a variety of modpacks, including Tekkit, Tekkit Lite, and Tekkit Classic.</p>

<p>The Tekkit Classic mod pack is the original pack that includes many older mods no longer being updated.</p>

<p>Tekkit Lite is a smaller, streamlined mod pack that is meant to be less resource intensive for less powerful gaming rigs.</p>

<p>The most up to date mod pack is Tekkit, although it is the biggest and most resource-heavy of the three.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-tekkit-server-in-minecraft">What is a Tekkit Server in Minecraft?</h2>

<p>In order to play Tekkit with your friends, you‚Äôll need a server. You could try to find one online, although modded servers might be harder to find than vanilla. Besides which, if it‚Äôs not your server, you have to play by someone else‚Äôs rules.</p>

<p>You could set up a server of your own, but that has its own drawbacks. Hosting your own server takes a bit of technical knowledge to set up and maintain. You may not be willing to invest the time to maintain a server.</p>

<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="PC" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/pc.jfif" /></p>

<p>A potentially larger downside of hosting your own server is that the server is only up when your computer is on. You‚Äôll have to decide between running your computer constantly or shutting it down periodically, which could restrict access by others.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in hosting your own server, there‚Äôs a section further down with more information.</p>

<p>The final option available is to <a href="/game-hosts/">rent a server</a>. Obviously, this option isn‚Äôt free, but it has a lot of upsides. Unlike your own server, a rented server will be up basically 24/7 and you won‚Äôt have to set up much or maintain it yourself.</p>

<p>Renting a Tekkit server is very similar to renting a regular Minecraft server, although not every provider will offer the option to include mods. Of those that do, some include free mod installation, while others take a bit of set-up.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-picked">How We Picked</h2>

<p>There are many Tekkit server providers on the market, and they all offer their own unique features and qualities. Depending on your needs and goals, you may find that one provider or another offers a more desirable package.</p>

<p>It is difficult to establish any one provider as superior, because varying needs will require different server options and features. Nonetheless, we have selected five Tekkit hosting companies that offer great value and features.</p>

<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="server" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/server.jfif" /></p>

<p>Among the qualities considered were cost, ease of mod installation, performance, server slots, support, as well as other included features.</p>

<p>You may find that the top pick does not suit your needs exactly, which is why we provided a number of alternatives that should cater to the differing needs of those looking to rent a server.</p>

<h2 id="top-pick">Top Pick:</h2>

<p>When looking at all factors and evaluating quality, price, and performance, there‚Äôs simply no one bringing more to the table than Citadel Servers.</p>

<p>To start, mods and mod packs can be installed with a single click on the Citadel Servers website. This convenience extends not just to Tekkit, but a whole host of other mods and plug-ins.</p>

<p>Servers from this provider include free DDOS protection as well as no limit to the number of players. In this instance, the only limit on players is how much RAM you have.</p>

<p>Dozens of servers are offered in locations across the US and Europe. If you‚Äôd like to splurge, you can even add premium support or a dedicated IP for an additional fee.</p>

<h2 id="runner-up">Runner Up:</h2>

<p>Another quality server provider with more tailored server packages is Nitrous Networks. Their Gold tier server package goes for just under $15 per month.</p>

<p>This tier includes 3 GB of RAM for around 1-15 players. Of course, if you want to go bigger, they offer packages for up to 300 players.</p>

<p>To install mods and packs with this server, you can simply add them with a single click from Nitrous‚Äô own server control panel.</p>

<p>Additionally, all Nitrous servers come with a free voice chat server as well as a web hosting server. If you want to engage with a larger community, these are great free tools.</p>

<p>This provider offers a respectable 8 locations across North America and Europe.</p>

<p>You may be instead looking for a Tekkit experience that requires very minimal knowledge and effort to install. It doesn‚Äôt get any easier than Apex Hosting.</p>

<p>To set up a mod with Apex, you can simply select Tekkit or another mod pack from the drop-down list as you are purchasing the server.</p>

<p>For an extra fee, you can even select up to 25 mods for the Apex team to custom install on your server.</p>

<p>Besides this extreme customizability, there are server locations offered all over the world, in every continent besides Antarctica.</p>

<p>You can also add a dedicated IP, premium support, or plug-in installation for a bit extra.</p>

<h2 id="performance-pick">Performance Pick:</h2>

<p>If you want the fastest, most powerful servers available, then <a href="/game-hosts/host-havoc/">Host Havoc</a> has the hardware to match your needs.</p>

<p>All Tekkit servers from this provider come equipped with NVMe SSD‚Äôs, which are much faster than a standard SSD. Additionally, Host Havoc uses server quality Intel Xeon processors, boasting speeds of up to 4.5 GHz.</p>

<p>Of course, speed is no good if your server is down. All servers have a 99.9% uptime guarantee, and if you need support, the average response time is less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Host Havoc has a couple of important downsides. Firstly, it only has three server locations in North America and one in Europe. You may find your ping to be rather high if you live too far away.</p>

<p>The other drawback of Host Havoc is mod installation. Unlike many other companies, it‚Äôs not a one-click process. It requires a couple downloads as well some file dragging and dropping.</p>

<p>If that <a href="https://hosthavoc.com/billing/index.php/knowledgebase/92/How-to-upload-and-set-up-a-mod-pack.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587861560832000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHkuqOZgcYeP6Q44aTB3HpLC1ZJQ" target="_blank">process</a> seems a tad complicated, you may prefer another option. However, if you‚Äôre all about speed, then Host Havoc is the indisputable choice.</p>

<h2 id="budget-pick">Budget Pick:</h2>

<p>Alternatively, you might be short on cash and not wishing to spend too much. GTX Gaming offers servers starting around $6.00, with plenty of customization available.</p>

<p>Servers start with 1 GB of RAM, but this can be upgraded along with the CPU and hard drive. Locations are plentiful, with servers available across six different continents.</p>

<p>In order to install Tekkit or other mods with this provider, simply fill out a support ticket with a link to the mod, and GTX will install it for free.</p>

<p>This provider offers excellent prices, as well as massive customizability. Even though they‚Äôre a budget pick, GTX Gaming offers servers for up to 180 players.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose-tekkit-server-hosting">How to Choose Tekkit Server Hosting</h2>

<p>Like we stated before, there‚Äôs no one absolute best option if you‚Äôre looking to rent a server. Different providers offer different features for varying prices. It all depends on the goals and objectives you have for your server.</p>

<p>The first things to look at are RAM and server slots. For a small server of friends, you won‚Äôt need many slots or a lot of memory. On the other hand, a giant community server will require much more of both.</p>

<p>For more information on RAM, check out the section below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cloudways.com/blog/how-server-location-affects-latency/" target="_blank">Server locations</a> are also vitally important when selecting a provider. The best hardware in the world won‚Äôt do a thing to help lag if you‚Äôre 2,000 miles away from the server.</p>

<p><img class="lazyload" alt="World Population Map" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/world.jfif" /></p>

<p>Ease of mod installation is another thing to evaluate. Some providers offer one-click installation, while other companies have a more involved set-up.</p>

<p>Depending on your technical ability, you may want to consider how much hassle you‚Äôre willing to go through.</p>

<p>DDOS protection is a great quality if you want to make sure that your server is secure.</p>

<p>After considering these major factors, there are a number of other features you may or may not want to shell out for.</p>

<p>Many providers offer hardware upgrade options that can improve your performance and speed.</p>

<p>There are also quality-of-life elements to consider. Automatic back-ups, game updates, and dedicated IP options make renting a server more simple.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-ram-do-you-need-for-a-tekkit-server">How Much RAM do you need for a Tekkit server?</h2>

<p>One of the most important things to consider when selecting any game server is the RAM requirements. Having too little RAM will cause lag and massive slowdowns, but you don‚Äôt want to purchase more than you need, as extra RAM inflates cost greatly.</p>

<p>Tekkit is a larger mod pack with many complex machines. Having a large number of machines running or a significant group online will certainly increase the amount of RAM needed.</p>

<p>That being said, 1-2 GB of RAM will usually suffice for a small server consisting of a few friends and low to medium machine usage. For 10 or more players, consider upgrading to 3-4 GB of RAM for the smoothest experience.</p>

<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="RAM" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/ram.jfif" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to create a large server of 50 or more people, aim for around 6-8 GB of RAM, and more as players increase further.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-host-a-tekkit-server">How to Host a Tekkit Server</h2>

<p>You may find that none of the aforementioned server providers suit your exact needs. Alternatively, you might just want to set up a server for the experience, or some other reason entirely.</p>

<p>In any case, hosting your own server is a perfectly viable option that won‚Äôt cost you a penny. It‚Äôs a bit harder than renting a server, but not nearly as difficult as it might sound.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll cover a quick rundown of what you need to know in this section, but you can also check out our more in-depth guide.</p>

<p>Before doing anything, you‚Äôll want to make sure that you have downloaded the latest versions of Minecraft and Java. Once you‚Äôve done that, you‚Äôll need to install the Java Development Kit.</p>

<p>From there, you can go to the Tekkit download page in a web browser and click the blue ‚ÄúServer Download‚Äù button.</p>

<p>The downloaded file will be zipped up, so you will have to right-click the folder and extract it. Once extracted, you can right-click the launch file and edit the available RAM for Tekkit, if needed.</p>

<p><img class="img-right img-small lazyload" alt="coding" data-src="/img/game-hosts/tekkit/coding.jfif" /></p>

<p>After clicking the launch file, you‚Äôll need to configure the port forwarding settings on your router if you plan to play with friends on another network.</p>

<p>The server should be running at this point. To connect from your machine, open Minecraft and input ‚Äúlocalhost‚Äù as the server address. Anyone on another network will need to add your IP for the server address.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that once your server is set-up, you‚Äôll have to save back-up files yourself, as well as updating the game periodically, if need be.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Minecraft is an amazing game with almost limitless possibilities thanks to its sandbox style gameplay. Once you add mods like Tekkit into the equation, the potential to create increases even further.</p>

<p>Like most great games, modded Minecraft is better with friends. If you‚Äôre on different networks, though, the only way to play is through servers.</p>

<p>That leaves a couple main options. You could create and host a server on your own computer. This is a great option if you like experimenting with tech, but it‚Äôs not for everyone.</p>

<p>The alternative is to rent a server. While it‚Äôs obviously not free, renting offers a ton of flexibility, and it‚Äôs much more straight-forward.</p>

<p>Easy installation, hardware upgrades, DDOS protection, world back-ups, and automatic game updates are just some of the amazing features available from different providers, should you choose to rent.</p>
