## The Phoenix 

This build is named the Phoenix for a reason. If you know anything about a phoenix, then you know they're awesome, as is this gaming PC. It's the best gaming PC under $700. 

A [$500 gaming PC](/budget-pcs/500/) isn't what it used to be. You'll have to spend $700 or more in 2018 to achieve the same performance that $500 would've gotten you a year ago thanks to cryptocurrency miners buying out GPUs and driving the prices through the roof. 

It's sporting a [Ryzen 3 1200](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0741DN383/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0741DN383&linkId=8d31b891d281885eded57ad6ef540469){:target="_blank"} which is a quad-core CPU with extreme overclocking potential. 

This means you'll be able to harness even more power out of your CPU, even with AMD's stock cooling solution. 

It also has a [GTX 1060 3GB](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338264454&customid=&icep_uq=GTX+1060+3GB&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){:target="_blank"}, great for gaming in 1080p and beyond. You'll see 60+ FPS with high-ultra settings in nearly all titles. 

You can expect to see 100+ FPS in competitive eSports titles like CS:GO and LOL. We know every frame counts, as it can be the difference between a win and a loss. 

I decided to link the GPU to eBay, as I figured you'd probably be able to find a better deal. GPU prices are crazy high right now, so it might not be a bad idea to buy a used GPU in order to save money. If you do buy used, make sure the card wasn't used for mining as that can really take a toll on the lifespan of the card.

If you'd rather buy new, that's fine too!

<img alt="bitfenix comrade 700 dollar gaming PC case" class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/img/case/comrade.png" />

The main purpose of this PC is gaming, and the parts were picked accordingly.  I'd like to address two things. 

First of all, I chose 8GB of RAM for this build. I know some newer games are recommending 12GB and even 16GB of ram. I also know that right now, RAM prices are through the roof. When push comes to shove, the GPU is far more important than RAM.  

Furthermore, *8GB of RAM is still plenty for a gaming PC under $700.* You won't suffer a notable loss of performance in-game. Most importantly of all, with the money you save on RAM you'll be able to spend on the GPU. From a gaming standpoint, it's the best move. 

Second of all, I decided to skip the HDD altogether and instead go for a 240GB [SSD](http://www.storagereview.com/ssd_vs_hdd){:target="_blank"}. 

The SSD doesn't really have any impact on performance in-game, but they're pretty sweet otherwise. They transform a 2-3 minute boot time into a 30 second boot time. 

Do you ever feel like you have to wait for your PC or laptop to 'warm up'? That's probably because you have a mechanical hard drive. SSDs work immediately. As soon as you turn on your PC it'll be ready to go. It also greatly increases your games' loading speeds. You'll be the first one loaded into every match!

The only downfall of an SSD is the price per GB of storage. It's a bit more than four times that of a mechanical drive. Instead of having 1TB of mass storage you're only going to have 240GB of space, so you'll have to watch your space.

I'd highly recommend adding a 500GB or ideally a 1TB mass storage mechanical drive to the build if you have the money for the addition. They can be found for less than $50 on Amazon. You can store your movies, music and other programs on this drive.

	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEIbbC_JxX4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Is an SSD Worth the Money? 

SSDs are quite pricey, especially compared to mechanical drives. For example, a 240GB SSD will cost you around $60, while a 1TB mechanical drive costs $50. 

So, are they really worth it? 

*YES*. Yes they are. 

SSDs are much faster than mechanical drives. If you buy a 240GB SSD, you can store your Windows OS, drivers, and some of your favorite games on it. Your PC's boot speeds will dramatically increase – furthermore, the overall compuer's usability is better, too. 

If you have evert felt like you need to let your PC 'warm up' after turning it on, you probably have a mechanical drive. With an SSD, you won't have to wait anymore! 

<figure>
	<img class="lazyload img-middle" alt="SSD example" data-src="/img/hdd/example.jpg" />
	<figcaption>SSDs significantly improve your PC's performance!</figcaption>
</figure>

Seriously, your PC will be ready to go within 30 seconds of hitting the power button. It's no joke! 

In addition, games installed on your SSD will load incredibly quickly. You'll be among the first loaded in the game! 

Of course, 240GB is not a lot of storage if you like to download photos, music, movies, applications, etc. For your mass storage, you can buy a 1TB mechanical hard drive. They're cheap, and work perfectly for regular file storage. 

*If you have the money for an SSD, buy one! They make your user experience 100x better!*

## Custom vs. Prebuilt Gaming PCs

Most prebuilt gaming PCs come with a powerful CPU, like an Intel i7. They have lots of RAM and a huge hard drive. Unfortunately, the manufacturers don't tell you the truth. 

What truth? 

Those things don't matter. They put crappy components in a nice case and market it as a "gaming PC". 

Well, we have news for you. These overpriced and underpowered prebuilt "gaming PCs" don't deserve the title. Video games aren't really processed by the CPU. In fact, they're processed by the GPU. The GPU is responsible for just about all of the 3D rendering and graphical processing. Hence the name "Graphics Processing Unit". 

As long as your CPU is fast enough to keep up with the GPU, you're in good shape. This means you can save some money and buy a cheaper CPU. With the money you saved, spend it on a more powerful GPU. Your powerful GPU will handle all of the 3D rendering in game, resulting in great FPS. 

![Gaming Setup](/img/pc-gaming/setup.jpg){: .img-middle}

However, this doesn't mean you can buy the cheapest CPU on the market. If your CPU is too underpowered, it'll hold back the GPU. This is called *bottlenecking*.

Anyway, back to the parts of a prebuilt gaming PC. Remember how I told you the GPU does all of the heavy lifting? Well, if you bought a prebuilt desktop with an Intel i7 and a GTX 750, you're out of luck.

Fortunately in 2018 *there are some viable prebuilt options*. You have to know what you're looking for, but if you buy the right PC you can actually make your money go a long way. 

Crytpocurrency miners want GPUs, not gaming PCs. This is why prebuilt PCs have maintained relatively the same (low) price. 

## A Prebuilt Gaming PC Under $700 
<a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH"><img class="lazyload img-middle" data-src="/img/case/xtreme.png" /></a>


Though most prebuilt gaming PCs are a ripoff, there are some viable prebuilt options. In this section, we're going to be taking a look at the best prebuilt gaming PC for $700. *Note that prices fluctuate daily.*

We think the [Cyberpower Gamer Xtreme VR](http://amzn.to/2BZL7FH){:target="_blank"} is the best prebuilt gaming PC for the money. 

**Let's take a look at the specs:** 

* Intel Core i5-7400 3.0GHz Quad-Core Processor
* 8GB DDR4 RAM
* 1TB HDD
* AMD Radeon RX 580 4GB
* Windows 10 

For $700, you're getting a PC with a 7th generation i5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and an RX 580 4GB, not to mention a full version of Windows 10. 

This is a great deal, considering you're also getting the PC prebuilt and shipped to your door. It comes in an awesome case too! 

You can expect to see 60+ FPS in most new titles with this PC, running at high-ultra settings.

## $700 Gaming PC Build Guide: AMD  

### The Case 
<img alt="bitfenix comrade" class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/case/comrade.png" />

Some spend lots of money on their case. A [good case](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/select-case,468.html){: target="_blank"} NEEDS to have these aspects: 

* Good cable management
* Good airflow
* [USB 3.0](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-usb-20-and-30/){:target="_blank"} Support
* Plenty of Space 
* Hard Drive Bays 
* Fans

That being said, many desire a good looking case as well. However, it is not necessary. 

The case chosen for this build, the [Bitfenix - Comrade](https://amzn.to/2LrnvBX){:target="_blank"} has all of the important aspects.  

For more information on cases, check out our guide on the [smallest ATX cases](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/)!

Specs: 

* Type: ATX Mid Tower
* Color: White
* Includes Power Supply: No
* External 5.25" Bays: 3
* Internal 2.5" Bays: 3
* Internal 3.5" Bays: 3
* Motherboard Compatibility: ATX, Micro ATX, Mini ITX

Believe it or not, this case is as good as it looks. If you think you want a different case, you can always buy a different one! Check out our guide about the [smallest atx cases!](/budget-pcs/smallest-atx-cases/)

Despite being a great case, you may want to consider buying aftermarket case fans to ensure the best airflow. Keeping your PC cool will prolong the lives of your components. Check out our guide on the [best case fans](/budget-pcs/case-fans/)!

### The Processor
![Ryzen 5 1400](/img/cpu/ryzen51400.png "Ryzen 5 1400"){: .img-right .img-small}

A gaming processor does not need to be the fastest processor on the market, as gaming relies on the GPU. However, an adequate [CPU](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150){:target="_blank"} is important. 

The processor must be fast enough to keep up with the GPU; moreover, it is important to use a processor that can hold its own in CPU intensive titles, as well as some workstation tasks. 

The [Ryzen 5 1400](https://amzn.to/2O6xXx2){:target="_blank"} is a great budget gaming CPU. It is able to hold its own in just about every game, especially when paired with a powerful GPU like the Radeon RX 580.  

This CPU also boasts incredible overclocking potential even with AMD's stock cooling solution. If you want to use the default stock cooler that ships with the Ryzen 5 1400, you should be able to achieve moderate overclocking, as the Ryzen stock coolers are actually quite good. 

If you want to achieve heavy overclocking, consider buying an aftermarket CPU cooler. 

Anyway, thanks to GPU and RAM prices finally cooling off, we're able to include the Ryzen 5 and an RX 580 in this build, as opposed to a Ryzen 3 and a GTX 1060. More on that later. 

**Here are the CPU's specs:**

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.2 GHz 
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz
* Cores: 4
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Multithreading: Yes (8 Threads)

### The Motherboard 
![ASRock AB350M](/img/mobo/asrock-ab350m.png "ASRock AB350M"){: .img-small .img-right}

Deciding which motherboard is right for you can be a daunting task. 

With many things to consider such as chipset, socket type, ram slots, PCI-E slots, fan connnectors, etc. it can be a lot to tackle all at once.

Fortunately, we've done all of the heavy lifting for you. 

For this build, the [ASRock - AB350M micro ATX AM4 motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X9LN3QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06X9LN3QK&linkId=f6f55287ac06445f3097836d1db39bf8){.big-button target="_blank"} was chosen. It supports 2400 MHz ram, it has onboard USB 3.0 headers, and much more. 

This motherboard pretty much has everything you need in a micro ATX form factor. 

Specs: 

* CPU Socket Type: AM4

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013GHSKR8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B013GHSKR8&linkId=0d7334df1529271aaa95c45fa55c1e7f) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the motherboard's B350 chipset, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our Ryzen CPU under heavy load.

### The Solid State Drive
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LrWO00"><img class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/hdd/sandisk-240.png" /></a>

The [SanDisk Ultra II 240GB SSD](https://amzn.to/2LrWO00){:target="_blank"} was chosen as the storage solution for this build. 

Although you're not getting nearly the same amount of storage as a traditional mechanical hard drive, you'll love the performance that this drive delivers. 

You'll experience **much faster boot speeds, loading times, and a better overall experience**. 

If you've ever felt like you needed to let your computer warm-up before you can really use it, it's probably because you have a mechanical hard drive. An SSD is ready to go immediately; although it doesn't really impact your in-game performance, it is definitely worth it. 

[Check out these ten reasons why you should buy an SSD](http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/store-ssd-10-reasons-to-buy){:target="_blank"}!

At the same time, having 1TB of storage can't hurt. If you can afford the additional $50, I recommend adding one to this build for your music, movies, and other programs.

### The Graphics Card 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Lpo1QJ"><img class="lazyload img-small img-right" data-src="/img/gpu/gigabyte-rx-580.png" /></a>

The GPU is easily the most important part of any gaming rig. Any well optimized PC game will primarily harness the power of your GPU, followed by your CPU and your ram, respectfully. 

For this $700 build, the [Gigabyte - Radeon RX 580 8GB Gaming 8G Video Card](https://amzn.to/2Lpo1QJ){: target="_blank"} was chosen. 

The RX 580 is one of the best GPUs on the market for less than $300. You can overclock it easily, and it is boasting 8GB of dedicated memory. If you want to play games in 1080p with high and ultra settings, having a lot of dedicated VRAM is important.

Moreover, this GPU is also a great cryptocurrency mining GPU. If you buy one now while it's cheap (GPU prices have cooled down because the cryptocurrency market is lower), you'll be able to use it for mining in the future, if you wish. 

For less than $300, this GPU is a steal. The RX 580 and Ryzen 5 1400 will deliver 60FPS in 1080p with high-ultra settings in most (if not all) titles. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: Radeon RX 580
* Memory Type: GDDR5
* Memory Size: 8GB
* Core Clock: 1.26 GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.35 GHz
* TDP: 185 Watts
* Length: 9.13"
* DVI-D Dual-Link: 1
* Displayport: 3
* HDMI: 1

### The Power Supply
![Corsair CX550M](/img/PSU/cx550m.png "Corsair CX550M"){: .img-small .img-right}

This build is pretty power efficient, but I decided to choose a powerful, efficient and future-proof PSU to power the components. 

The [Corsair CX550M](https://amzn.to/2JJDDJU){:target="_blank"} was selected. It's an efficient 80+ Bronze Certified power supply, and it's semi modular. This will help with cable management. 

Having good cable management not only improves the looks of your build, but with airflow as well. This is important as you'll ideally be overclocking your CPU and RAM to achieve maximum performance. If you'd like you could even overclock your GPU. 

Since GPU prices are high, we had to save on other components. Overclocking the Ryzen 3 1200 is a great way to get the most out of the CPU, especially considering its insane overclocking potential. 

Ryzen's performance heavily depends on RAM speed which is why I'd recommend you overclock your RAM as well. This PSU has more than enough power to get the job done, and it's efficient too!

Specs:

* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 550 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: Semi
* Efficiency: 80+ Bronze
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors: 2

### The Case 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NdHG85"><img alt="Deepcool Tesseract SW ATX Mid Tower" class="img-right img-small" data-src="/img/case/deepcool-tesseract-sw.jpg" /></a>

I decided to switch things up a bit with this build. If you're in favor of the Intel build, I'm assuming you're a member of Team Blue, which is why I chose a case with brilliant blue LED lighting. It's a wonderful entry-level case, which is perfect for inexperienced builders. 

On the other hand, if you're more intermediate or experienced, you'll still enjoy working with the Tesseract SW. 

The case is tasked with protecting your precious components from harm, providing adequate airflow, staying quiet, and looking good too. Most entry-level cases are plagued by cramped interiors and flimsy designs – believe it or not, for the low price of ~$50, the Tesseract SW has a clean and spacious interior, and a good-looking design. 

Great cable management and impeccable build quality are two of the most important factors to consider when it comes to your PC's case. Deepcool has manufactured a budget-friendly case that gets the job done without breaking the bank. It has fantastic LED lighting and a large side-panel window, allowing you to peek inside to see your components at work. 

The case has a rubber strip running along the border of the I/O panel located in the rear of the case. The inside of the case is constructed with aluminium, so it's easy to attach magnetic lighting LED strips. 

The exterior of the case is also constructed from aluminium, and the overall design is simple and straightforward with a few added touches for some extra flare. The front of the case features the Deepcool logo. The front panel is perforated, allowing the 120mm intake fan to work its magic. 

There is one USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 port, as well as a microphone and headphone jack located next to the front I/O panel. The front of the case also has two I/O LEDs, one of which is a hard drive LED, and the other is for system power. 

Believe it or not, this case can actually house up to six 120mm fans. You can mount two on the top of the case, one in the rear, two on the left side, and one in the front. Evidently, airflow won't be an issue. The case also has two water cooling grommets if you wish to mount an external pump and reservoir for water cooling. The case has adequate airflow and dust filtration, especially if you fill every fan spot. 

The case has seven expansion card slots, and the right side of the case has an extension which is meant to help with cable management, the importance of which can hardly be overstated. 

If you take a look inside of the case, you'll see that it has several holes for cable management (your PSU's cables have to be long enough.) It also supports ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX boards. The case can accomodate you, no matter the form factor you select for your build. 

As far as drive bays are concerned, this case has four 3.5-inch drive bays and three 2.5-inch drive bays, in addition to several 5.25-inch drive bays, all of which are removeable. 

### The Processor 
<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ot1ilc"><img class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/cpu/intel-core-i5-8400.jpg" /></a>

I chose the [Intel Core i5-8400](https://amzn.to/2Ot1ilc){: target="_blank"} for this build's CPU (after all, it is an Intel build.)

Rather than going for the unlocked K version of the CPU, I chose the 8400 because it is the most cost effective on this budget. The AMD build is harnessing the power of the Ryzen 5 1400, which also happens to be $50 cheaper than Intel's competitor, the 8400. The CPU for this build is $200  – any extra money on the CPU would've been too much on a $700 budget. 

I've always been an AMD fan myself, as I believe their CPUs – the Ryzen line especially – are more cost effective. That is, they offer a better bang for your PC gaming buck. Although, Intel CPUs tend to outperform AMD in most gaming related tasks. 

This CPU is more than capable of keeping up with the GPU without bottlenecking, which is the most important thing to consider when determining your CPU/GPU combo: 

1. Buy the best GPU you can afford
2. Buy a CPU that's fast enough to keep up with it 

In addition to providing excellent gaming performance, the Intel Core i5-8400 is a powerhouse, meaning it's great for editing, rendering, streaming, and multitasking. Overall, it's a fantastic CPU for gaming, especially if you're interested in playing games like PUBG or Battlefield that draw power from the CPU in games with many players. 

### The Motherboard 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MCUUWT"><img class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/mobo/msi-b360-gaming-plus.png" /></a>

The [MSI Performance Gaming B360](https://amzn.to/2MCUUWT){: target="_blank"} has a B360 chipset, which suffers from certain limitations. For example, it doesn't support overclocking, and RAM frequency is limited to 2666MHz. Evidently, B360 chipset motherboards are targetted at those with locked Intel CPUs and single graphics card configurations.  

Considering you're building a gaming PC on a $700 budget, you won't be able to afford expensive water coolers or dual-GPU configurations. Moreover, the i5-8400 is a locked CPU, meaning it doesn't support overclocking. Choosing a motherboard with a pricier chipset would be a waste of money. 

Besides, running a locked Core i5 with a high-performance GPU and 8GB of DDR4 2400 memory is still going to deliver plenty of gaming performance, which is *exactly* what we're after. The limitations will hardly impact most casual gamers, especially beginner builders on a budget. This means the B360 is a stronger value for the money than other chipsets, including H370.

Board connectivity is good for the price. You'll enjoy a front panel USB 3.1 header, seven fan headers and three RGB headers. It also has EZ Debug LED system with lights for CPU, DRAM, VGA and BOOT. The rear I/O panel has plenty of USB 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1 ports, legacy PS/2 for peripherals, a few modern display outputs, and Gigabit Ethernet. 

The CPU socket has access to two fan headers with a few sys fan headers nearby. 

It's a solid motherboard for a modest price that will surely get the job done, and it'll last a long time. 

### The RAM
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MCV9RN"><img class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/ram/g-skill-ripjaws-v.jpg" />  

For the Intel build, I chose to include the same <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MCV9RN">2x4GB 2400MHz RAM kit</a>. Although some titles are starting to recommend 12GB and even 16GB of RAM for optimal performance, 8GB of RAM is still sufficient. 

Moreover, you can always add an additional 8GB kit of RAM in the future for a total of 16GB. As long as you don't have any other programs open that consume a lot of RAM, you won't have any issues running games in 2018. 

### The Solid State Drive 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LrWO00"><img class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/hdd/sandisk-240.png" /></a>

I decided to include the same [250GB SSD](https://amzn.to/2LrWO00){: target="_blank"} in the Intel build, because having an SSD in your computer makes a *huge* difference. However, it's important to note that it only has 250GB of storage space. For most people, it's not enough. 

I have a 1TB hard drive, a 250GB SSD in my rig. I have enough room for 3-4 games that I play the most on my SSD, in addition to my Windows operating system, drivers, and a few other files, with around 60GB of free space. The rest of my files are on my mass storage drive. 

If you can't afford an SSD and a 1TB drive, I'd recommend buying the SSD first and adding another mass storage drive in the future when you really need it (and when you have the money for it). 

Believe me when I say the difference between a mechanical drive and a solid state drive is night and day. Your PC will boot much more quickly and it will be far more responsive. Your PC will operate smoothly, boot quickly, and you'll be the firt person to load into a game. 

### The Graphics Card 
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Lpo1QJ"><img class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/gpu/gtx-1060-dual.png" />

Instead of an AMD Radeon card, I decided to pick the [ASUS GeForce GTX 1060 3GB DUAL exhaust GPU](https://amzn.to/2Lpo1QJ){: target="_blank"}. It has 3GB of dedicated memory, which is ideal for 1080p gaming. Moreover, its dual exhaust fans help to maintain cool temperatures, even under heavy load. 

The card can handle mainstream titles in 1080p with ease – whether you want to play Fortnite, PUBG, Battlefield, or Call of Duty Blackout, this card can do it all. 

It won't be able to max out games in 1440p, but you'll enjoy 60 FPS in 1080p with high-ultra settings. Since the CPU was more expensive in this build, I wasn't able to include a GTX 1060 with 6GB of memory, which would've been the ideal choice. If you have an extra $100 to spare, I'd *highly* recommend swapping the GTX 1060 3GB for a GTX 1070, as it will offer a significant performance boost. 

### The Power Supply
<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2xoYVsf"><img class="lazyload img-right img-small" data-src="/img/PSU/500b.png" /></a>

I chose the [EVGA 500B](https://amzn.to/2xoYVsf){: target="_blank"} 500 watt 80+ Bronze Certified power supply. It isn't modular, but it will supply adequate power for the build, it's cheap, and it's power efficient. 

Considering you won't be overclocking the CPU, nor will you be running two GPUs in an SLI configuration, there's no need for a lot of excess power. A modular power supply would be nice for cable management, but modular power supplies tend to be more expensive, and the case has plenty of cable management options that will ensure good airflow.

## My Thoughts on a $700 Gaming PC 

I've been a PC gamer since I was 13 when I built my first gaming PC in the 8th grade. 

Prior to my enlightenment, I played a whole lot of Call of Duty on the Xbox 360. When the Xbox One came out, I decided I'd rather build a gaming PC than buy a new console. 

I could either: 

**A)** Buy a $500 Xbox One and a $500 laptop

*or*

**B)** Build a $1,000 gaming computer 

I decided to build a $1,000 gaming computer, because a gaming PC with that budget can game in higher resolution, with better graphics and framerates, than an Xbox. Additionally, it can do everything a normal computer can do! 

Actually, I spent $700 on the PC. Now I'm going to share my experience with the build: 

It was my first build, and I didn't really know what I was doing. I spent too much on the processor, and too little on the graphics card. 

Despite my poor choice of components, the PC was still *awesome*. You can build a mean gaming PC with $700.

I ended up selling my PC after two years, because I didn't have a job and I wanted money for a car. I built another gaming PC one year ago with another $700 budget, and it runs all of the games I want to play with great framerates in 1080p. 

What's the bottom line here?

With $700, you can build not only a powerful gaming PC, but a great computer as well. If you're thinking of joining the PC gaming community, $700 is an ideal budget.  

## Intel i3 vs. Ryzen 3 

Up until recently, it was obvious that AMD's Ryzen 3 line held the title of "The King of Budget Gaming CPUs". Before Ryzen 3 was released, your only real options were the skylake i3 CPUs, or the Pentium G4560. Both choices didn't sport four cores; only dual cores with hyperthreading. 

At the time they were great, as the four threads did a great job. Of course, once AMD launched a quad core CPU for a lower price, it was game over. AMD's Ryzen line outperformed Intel's closest offerings in just about every category except for single-threaded performance. 

As we all expected, Intel fought back. They released their Coffe Lake CPUs, the 8th generation of the Intel i3 line. They're priced similarly to the Ryzen 3 line, and they have four true cores as well. In fact, they show similar if not better performance in most categories. 

Unfortunately, the lowest-priced motherboards available for this chip at this time are all over $100. This makes it hard to consider them a "budget gaming CPU". 

Until cheaper motherboards are released for the new line of Intel CPUs, Ryzen 3 will remain our budget CPU of choice. 

We also have a guides for [$400](/budget-pcs/400/), [$500](/budget-pcs/500/), [$600](/budget-pcs/600/), and [$800](/budget-pcs/800/) budget gaming PCs!

Lastly, you'll need the best gaming mouse to accompany your new gaming PC. If you're left handed, finding a good mouse can be tricky. Check out our guide on the [best left handed gaming mice](/left-handed-gaming-mouse/)!
