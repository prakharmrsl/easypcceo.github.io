## The Best $600 Prebuilt Gaming PC

If you decide you want a prebuilt gaming PC, the [Dell Inspiron 5675 Gaming PC](http://amzn.to/2FHqfVe){:target="_blank"} is the best prebuilt gaming PC under $600 in 2018. 

In fact, it's one of my personal favorites – the rig looks great and more importantly, it's powerful!

This PC can handle 1080p gaming with no problem. Expect to see 60 FPS in almost all titles with a mix of high-ultra settings. 

The power of the Ryzen 5 1400 CPU is an absolute beast, especially when overclocked. AMD's stock cooling solution is perfect for light overclocking. When combined with the RX 570 4GB, it'll handle 1080p gaming with ease.

**Check out this PC's specs:**

## $600 Build Guide

### The Case
![Cuboid-r1](/img/case/cuboid-r1.jpg "Cuboid R1"){: .img-small .img-right}

### The Processor
![Ryzen 3 1200](/img/cpu/ryzen3.png "Ryzen 3 1200"){: .img-right .img-small}


The new Ryzen 3 lineup from AMD is easily the BEST line of budget gaming CPUs on the market today. 

Ryzen 3 is the final piece of the puzzel. It only comes in at $110, and blows Intel out of the water. 

The processor chosen for this build is the [Ryzen 3 1200](https://amzn.to/2LuYK7M).

Specs: 

* Data Width: 64-bit
* Socket Type: AM4
* Operating Frequency: 3.1 GHz
* Max Turbo Frequency: 3.4 GHz 
* Cores: 4
* Lithography: 14 nm
* TDP: 65 Watts
* Includes CPU Cooler: Yes
* Simultaneous Multithreading: No
* Integrated Graphics: No

Intel saw Ryzen coming a mile away. They gave Pentium CPUs hyperthreading in order to compete with Ryzen 3 CPUs. 

However, Ryzen 3 CPUs are not just multithreaded like Intel Pentium CPUs. They are full on quad-core CPUs. 

It only has half the cache of the Ryzen 5 and  7, but it still has all of the same features. 

In nearly every area that doesn't involve multithreaded performance, [Linus Tech Tips](https://linustechtips.com/main/), both Ryzen 3 chips outperform their Intel competitors. 

Ryzen 3 makes a lot of sense.

### The Motherboard
![ASRock B250M HDV](/img/mobo/asrock-ab350m.png){: .img-small .img-right}


Finding the right motherboard is important, as is any other part in a gaming PC. However, there may be more to consider than you're aware of. 

Things like PCI slots, chipsets, socket types, ram support/speed, etc. That being said, the cheapest motherboard may not be the best choice. 

Since the Ryzen 3 1200 is being used, 2400 MHz ram is optimal to boost the CPUs performance. 

This is why the [ASRock AB350M-HDV MicroATX Motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9BY912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01N9BY912&linkId=6b6b6e19af89dfba6b3f388ed0e6834c) was chosen for this PC. 

The micro-ATX form factor is fitting for this "stealth" build, and it supports 2400 MHz ram due to its B250 chipset. 

Specs:

* Socket Type: AM4
* Chipset: AMD B350
* Memory Slots: 2x 288-pin DIMM
* Memory Type: DDR4-2133/2400/2666/2933/3000
* Max Supported Memory: 32GB
* Sata 6 GB/s: 4
* Onboard USB 3.0 Headers: Yes
* Onboard Ethernet: 1 x 10/100/1000 Mbps

This motherboard has all of the necessary components, all packed nicely into a micro-ATX form factor.

### The Ram 
![Ram](/img/ram/gskill-v-2x4.png "Ripjaws V Series 2x4GB 2400 MHz"){: .img-small .img-right}


Ram is an important part of every gaming PC. Moreover, higher frequency ram has the potential to increase the performance of the CPU. 

This build utilizes [2x4GB 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series Ram](https://amzn.to/2zTPKV6) for a total of 8GB. 

Specs:

* Type: 288-pin DIMM
* Speed: DDR4-2400
* Size: 8GB (2 x 4GB)
* Color: Black/Red
* Heat Spreader: Yes

Though some games recommend 16GB of ram, 8GB is plenty for gaming today, and the difference in performance between 8GB and 16GB is virtually zero. 

Due to the B250 chipset of the motherboard, 2400 MHz ram is supported. This will help our CPU under heavy load.

### The Hard Drive 
![Caviar Blue](/img/hdd/1tb.png  "1TB Hard Drive"){: .img-small .img-right}


The [WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200 RPM HDD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cryptocurrency06-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0088PUEPK&linkId=ebd1ec7b7b862a7d17070d2b1ea21b01) is today's standard mass storage drive for good reason. 

1TB of storage is plenty for your OS, drivers, video games, music, videos, etc. Furthermore, this HDD is known for its reliability and dependibility. 

It is a 7200 RPM hard drive, meaning load times are signficantly quicker than a 5400 RPM hard drive. 

Unfortunately we were not able to include an SSD in this build. However, you can find SSDs on [eBay](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575177097&toolid=10001&campid=5338146172&customid=&icep_uq=solid+state+drive&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg) at a low cost.

### The Graphics Card 
![GTX 1060 3GB](/img/gpu/gtx-1060-dual.png "GTX 1060 3GB"){: .img-right .img-small}


The GPU is probably the most important part of a gaming PC. It handles all of the 3D rendering. In the case of [crypto mining](/crypto-mining/), the GPU does all of the heavy lifting. 

In this build, the [GTX 1060 3GB Dual-Fan GPU](https://amzn.to/2LuPW1U) was chosen. It was hard to fit this GPU in the budget due to the spike in GPU pricing recently, but we made it happen.

The GTX 1060 3GB does well in nearly all titles, even in 1080P. Much like other Pascal GPUs, the 1060 increases clock speeds relative to the previous generation. 

Specs: 

* Interface: PCI-Express x16
* Chipset: GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
* Memory Size: 3GB
* Memory Type: GDDR5
* Core Clock: 1.59GHz
* Boost Clock: 1.81GHz
* TDP: 120 Watts
* Length: 9.53"

This GPU/CPU combo boasts 60fps at max settings in games like GTA V, The Witcher 3, Battlefield 1, Player Unknown's Battle Grounds, and many more titles.

### The Power Supply
![EVGA 450 Watt](/img/PSU/450w.jpg "EVGA 450 Watt"){: .img-small .img-right}


As PC parts become ever more efficient, the total power consumption of a PC build lowers. This "stealth" build only uses 256 watts. 

The [EVGA 450 watt power supply](https://amzn.to/2LC3NAi) was chosen for the build. It has an 80+ bronze power efficiency certification. 

Though it is not modular, the case in this build allows for proper cable management. 

Specs:

* Type: ATX
* Wattage: 450 Watts
* Fans: 1
* Modular: No
* Efficiency Certification: 80+ Bronze
* Efficiency: >85% 
* PCI-Express 6+2-Pin Connectors: 2

## The Stealth Gamer - A Gaming PC Under 600 Dollars 

This $600 gaming PC build is absolutely insane...

For just $600 you're getting a PC with a Ryzen 3 1200 Quad Core CPU, which is easily overclockable to 4.0 GHz. Furthermore, the PC is sporting a GTX 1060, one of the most cost effective graphics cards on the market. 

Lastly, the PC is housed by the DIYPC - Cuboid-R, a compact and good-looking case. It is a micro-ATX form factor, hence the name of this PC. The small case truly is stealthy – not to mention, super cool!

<figure>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LBwxct"><img class="img-middle" src="/img/case/cuboid-r1.jpg" /></a>
	<figcaption>The DIY-PC Cuboid R</figcaption>
</figure>

In all honesty, $600 is a sweet spot in terms of the 'perfect gaming PC budget'. I'm often asked how much I recommend spending on a gaming PC, and I always say it depends on what you're looking to do with it. 

For e-sports titles like League of Legends and CS:GO, a $400 rig is going to be sufficient. However, if you want to play more intensive games like Battlefield, Fortnite, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, GTA V or PUBG, you'll want to spend a bit more. 

Luckily for you, this PC can run all titles with a mix of high-ultra settings in 1080p without any issues. 

As for the storage, this build features a 1TB mass storage drive, the WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200RPM HDD. It's a fan favorite for its cheap and reliable storage. 

Although, adding an SSD to the build is *highly recommended*. If you've ever turned on a computer and felt like you have to wait for the computer to 'warm up' then you probably have a mechanical drive.

Mechanical hard drives like the Caviar Blue 1TB from Western Digital are awesome for storing movies, music, programs, pictures, and even some games. However, if you want the *best* performance from your gaming PC, you should consider buying an SSD. 

I did not include one in this build because it wasn't in the budget, but if you can afford to spend an extra $60 for a 240GB SSD, you'll be much better off. 

240GB is plenty for Windows, your drivers, and some of your favorite games. Your PC will cold boot in less than 30 seconds, you'll load into your games before anyone else, and your PC will remain incredibly responsive. 

Combining a 240GB SSD with a 1TB mass storage drive is optimal and will provide the best overall experience!

## Additional Things to Consider

The build guide above covers the bear minimum – you're still going to need to buy some extra peripherals including a mouse, keyboard, monitor, wifi card, etc. The next portion of this guide is going to highlight some of the additional things you may want to include in your new PC gaming setup. 

### A Gaming Keyboard

If you're thinking about getting into PC gaming, you're probably wondering what it's like to game with a keyboard and mouse, especially if you're coming over from console. 

In my experience, using a keyboard and mouse is *far superior* to a controller. A mouse can detect precise movements, whereas a joystick on a more traditional controller is clunky. Moreover, your wrist is significantly more precise than your thumbs.

Don't get me wrong, it will take you a while to learn the keyboard and mouse – but once you figure things out, you'll wonder how you ever played games with a console controller! 

Anyway, trying to game with an old keyboard, or one that wasn't designed for gaming, can be a bit tricky to say the least. 

**You'll want to invest in a gaming keyboard for a few reasons:**

* Gaming keyboards are designed to deliver the best gaming performance
* You want a keyboard that is comfortable for you, even after an all night gaming session 
* Gaming keyboards often come equipped with cool LED lights that add some personality to your setup

Knowing [how to buy a great gaming keyboard](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/buy-gaming-keyboard-guide,review-3368.html){: target="_blank"} is important. 

Some keyboards have membrane switches – this means the keys feel a bit mushy. Most gamers, myself included, prefer a 'crisper' response when we press a key. That's why I'd recommend going for a mechanical keyboard. 

**Here are some popular gaming keyboards to consider:** 

* [Logitech G513](https://amzn.to/2J8FUlO){: target="_blank"} – $150 
* [Razer BlackWidow Chroma V2](https://amzn.to/2J8XxBR){: target="_blank"} – $130
* [Razer Cynosa Chroma](https://amzn.to/2LAeofc){: target="_blank"} – $60
* [HyperX Alloy Elite](https://amzn.to/2kr4Y9y){: target="_blank"} – $110

### A Gaming Mouse 

As mentioned previously, a [proper gaming mouse](https://www.avadirect.com/blog/what-makes-a-good-gaming-mouse/){: target="_blank"} gives you the competitive edge you need to smash the competition. No matter what kind of gamer you are or what games you enjoy playing, buying the right mouse is imperative.

There are different kinds of grips, and different mice are better for each type. Your mouse has to feel comfortable in your hand. If you're competitive, you'll want a highly precise mouse. 

Lastly, most gaming mice come equipped with programmable buttons known as macros which you can use easily configure to suit your needs. 

**Here are some popular gaming mice to consider:** 

* [Razer DeathAdder Elite](https://amzn.to/2Lxizsg){: target="_blank"} – $53
* [Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum](https://amzn.to/2IQXSWC){: target="_blank"} – $50 
* [Logitech G703](https://amzn.to/2GSoNzr){: target="_blank"} – $100

### A Great Gaming Headset

The quality of your gaming headset is equally important as the quality of your keyboard and mouse. Sound quality helps to immersify you in the game you're playing. If it's a competitive title like CS:GO, Fortnite or PUBG, you definitely want to be able to hear your opponents. Sound gives you far more information than you may think! 

**With that being said, here are some popular gaming headsets to consider:**

* [Razer KrakenPro V2](https://amzn.to/2JciUCE){: target="_blank"} – $70
* [ HyperX Cloud Revolver S](https://amzn.to/2xgn9bm){: target="_blank"} – $150

### An Optical Drive 

Although an optical drive isn't necessary, you may want to include one in your build. Luckily, you can buy a standard DVD/CD writer for less than $20. However, if you want to watch Blue Ray movies, you will probably end up paying a bit more. 

Keep in mind that you **DO NOT** need an optical drive to install Windows 10. In fact, now Windows is usually installed via a USB flash drive. In my opinion, an optical drive is totally optional. I'd recommend buying a $20 standard DVD/CD writer. 

I have one in my PC, but I rarely use it – actually, the only time I ever have used my optical drive was to install the default motherboard drivers, but that can easily be done online as well. 

**Either way, here are some optical drives to consider:** 

* [ASUS 24x DVD-RW Serial-ATA OEM Optical Drive](https://amzn.to/2Lv1NtQ) – $20
* [ASUS Blue Ray Drive](https://amzn.to/2J7rgvg) – $70

### A Fast WiFi Card

Regardless of the games you enjoy playing, a proper internet connection is mandatory. Even if you don't play multiplayer games, you still want a good internet connection to download games, stream music, watch videos, etc. 

A wired connection with an ethernet cable is optimal to provide the best connection. Unfortunately, not everyone can set up their PC next to their router. If you can't there are still plenty of options open to you. 

**First option:** You could always buy a long ethernet cable and wire it through your house. However, this option is costly and time consuming. Unless you want to drill holes in your walls/floor, I'd recommend avoiding this option. 

**Second option:** Using a power line adapter is probably your best bet if you want a great wired connection. Rather than running an ethernet cable all throughout your house, you can make use of your house's existing infrastructure.

Powerline adapters use your house's electrical wiring to run the internet connection from your router to anywhere else in your house. Click [here](https://www.techradar.com/news/networking/powerline-networking-what-you-need-to-know-930691){: target="_blank"} to learn more about powerline adapters and how you can use one! 

**Third option:** Rather than choosing a wired connection, you can always use a USB WiFi adapter. They're not as fast as a wired connection, but they're pretty darn close, not to mention cheap and easy! 

**Here are some popular WiFi adapters to consider:** 

* [OURLINK 600Mbps mini 802.11ac Dual Band 2.4G/5G Wireless Network Adapter](https://amzn.to/2GS4pi5) – $16
* [TP-Link AC600 Wireless High Gain Dual Band USB Adapter (Archer T2UH)](https://amzn.to/2KXICb6) – $20

## Should You Buy an SSD? 

In short, *yes*, yes you should. 

Solid State Drives (SSDs) significantly improve your PC's overall performance. Although more expensive than traditional storage solutions, they're well worth the money. 

You can pick up a 240GB SSD for around $60. That's a perfect amount of storage for your Windows OS, drivers and some games. 

Seriously, spend the extra money. If you've ever felt like you have to let your computer 'warm up' for a while after you turn it on, it's probably because your Windows is loaded on a mechanical hard drive. They are cheap, and great for mass storage, but that's about it. 

If you install your Windows on an SSD, your PC will cold boot (that is, starting completely turned off, not in sleep mode, etc.) to being fully functional and ready to go in less than 30 seconds. Really, I'm not kidding. 

Moreover, you'll find your applications loading far quicker, not to mention your games. You'll be the first one loaded into the game! 

If you have the extra money to spend, buy an SSD. We couldn't include one in this gaming PC under 600 dollars, because most people prefer having the extra storage. A 1TB mechanical drive will cost you around $50, whereas a 240GB SSD will run you around $60. However, it's well worth the investment. 

You can either skip the mechanical drive and go straight for the SSD, as long as you're careful with your storage. Otherwise, you can get an SSD for Windows, games, etc. and a mass storage drive for everything else.
