7 Days to Die is a survival horror game set in an open world, allowing players to gather resources, craft items, build a base, kill enemies (zombies) and survive.

Although the game has been in Alpha for literally years now, it remains one of the most popular multiplayer zombie survival games on the market.

7 Days to Die offers an awesome blend of fighting, crafting, looting, exploration and mining. You can create the ultimate world, upgrade your choice of five different skill trees, fight 50 different types of zombies, destroy buildings, loot gear to keep you alive, quest and level up, drive vehicles, farm, etc.

Whether you're a fighter, builder, survivalist, or farmer, 7 Days to Die has something for everyone.

But the game truly shines when you play with friends.

Of course, in order to play with friends you'll need a server. You could join a public server, but that'd leave you to the mercy of their rules, and you very well may run into some not-so-friendly people.

Instead, hosting a private 7 Days to Die server allows complete freedom, total control, and a 24/7 gaming experience.

You can setup your own server, but renting a server is the way to go for most people. The next section will cover each option in a bit more detail so you can make the best choice.

## Renting a 7 Days to Die Server vs Hosting Your Own

<img class="lazyload" alt="7 days to die game cover photo" data-src="/img/game-hosts/7-days/cover.jpg">

You're reading this because you want to host a 7 Days to Die server for you and your friends. You can either host it on your own machine, or pay a hosting company like [Host Havoc](/game-hosts/host-havoc/) or [GTX Gaming](/game-hosts/gtx-gaming/) to host the server for you.

If you want to host a server on your own machine, you're going to need a pretty beefy rig. The more players that join, the more taxing the server will be on your computer, not to mention the demand of the game itself.

7 Days to Die servers seem to be especially taxing on your system's RAM, so if you choose to host it yourself, make sure you have _at least_ 8GB of RAM, though 16GB of RAM is ideal (more on that below).

When you rent a server, on the other hand, you don't need to worry about RAM - the hosting company will do that for you after you select the server's player count.

Hosting your own server is alright if you want to play with a few friends, but it's not a good idea for a public server.

Aside from needing a powerful computer and internet connection to avoid lag, your friends can only join when your computer is on and the server is running.

If you guys only plan on playing at the same time, this isn't an issue. But if they want to get on when you're not home or sleeping, they won't be able to, which is frustrating.

7 Days to Die hosting companies have 24/7 uptime and take care of the annoying setup process for you.

At the end of the day, both options work. Doing it yourself is free, but takes longer to setup and has its limitations (especially if you're not running a top-notch machine).

Hosting companies aren't free, but they are fast, dependable, and easy to work with. In my opinion, their convenience and ease-of-use is totally worth it.

## 7 Days to Die Server Hosting Requirements

<img class="lazyload img-right img-small" alt="7 days to die game banner" data-src="/img/game-hosts/7-days/game.jpg">

7 Days to Die seems to be pretty demanding of server hardware, especially when it comes to RAM.

According to the [official Wiki](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/System_Requirements){: target="\_blank"}, the game has the following minimum requirements:

- **CPU:** 2.4 GHz Dual Core CPU
- **RAM:** 8GB
- **Graphics:** 2 GB dedicated memory

And here are the recommended specs:

- **CPU:** 3.0 GHz Quad Core CPU or faster
- **RAM:** 12GB
- **Graphics:** 4 GB dedicated memory

You can click the link above for the full list of requirements.

_The thing is, those requirements are for the game itself, not a 7 Days to Die Server_. At the bottom of the page, the notes say "Running the Dedicated Server and Client on the same computer will double ram requirements."

And on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/a9impm/7_days_to_die_server_46_players_requirements/){: target="\_blank"}, a user said:

<blockquote>
  <p>I would say if it is only for 7dtd then go for a host that has dedicated game servers, most of them allow ftp access to upload mods and a control panel to handle all the settings of the server. If you want to handle it all yourself then I can tell you that when my server is idle with no users it uses 3 GB of ram and then about 0.5 GB pr player online.</p>
</blockquote>

That means you need a pretty beefy computer if you want to play on the same computer you're using to host a server.

I wouldn't recommend hosting a server for more than a few people if you have any less than 8GB and a quad core i5 or Ryzen 5 CPU. It'd be better if you had 16GB of RAM, however.

GTX Gaming offers 7 Days to Die servers start below $10 per month, and are the premier host for the game.

The control panel is designed specifically for 7 Days to Die, which is pretty awesome. It has simple sliders and text input fields which are easy for a beginner, but still supports the advanced functionalities a seasoned gamer would expect.

GTX Gaming supports 7 Days to Die mods, free DDoS protection, and offer a 24 hour refund if you're not totally satisfied.

One of the best parts about GTX Gaming is their game switching feature, which allows you to switch your 7 Days to Die server out for any other game down the line if you want, free of charge. They'll even save your server settings so you can switch back and forth.

Again, their 7 Days to Die servers start at $9.20 per month for a 10 slot server, which is insanely cheap for the game.

They're charging $0.92 per slot for the game, and their server slots go all the way up to 120 people (the biggest capacity on our list).

You probably won't need that many slots, however, but GTX still has your back - their minimum slot count is only 10 players, which is lower than the competition.

You can choose memory, hard drive, and CPU power add ons which will up the price (like most companies), and committing to a quarterly, semi annual or annual billing cycle will bring your costs down even more.

All in all, GTX Gaming is my top pick for 7 Days to Die. If you want to learn more about the company, check out my [GTX Gaming review](/game-hosts/gtx-gaming/)!

Slightly more expensive but still awesome, PingPerfect is another great 7 Days to Die hosting company.

Their servers start at $0.98 per slot, and their minimum slot count is 12, which means the base price for a server comes out to $11.76.

However, PingPerfect also includes free web hosting with every game server, so you can create an online community for your server. Considering it's just barely more expensive than GTX Gaming, it's hard to argue with the value there.

PingPerfect also has terrific support (more on that in our [PingPerfect review](/game-hosts/pingperfect/)) and great performance.

Overall, you can't go wrong with a PingPerfect 7 Days to Die server.

{% include host-havoc.html %}

Host Havoc is another one of my top hosting companies (find out why in my [Host Havoc review](/game-hosts/host-havoc/)).

They're the most expensive 7 Days to Die server hosting company for small servers, but actually become pretty affordable if you're renting a large server.

Here's why:

Host Havoc has a tiered pricing system, in which the price per slot goes down as your slot count increases. It's basically a 'bulk discount'.

While your monthly cost will go up with more slots, the price you're paying per slot goes down, so you're getting more for your money.

For example, Host Havoc's 14 slot servers (their minimum slot count for 7 Days to Die) are $1 per slot.

Their maximum slot count of 40 only costs $0.59 per slot, nearly half the cost of GTX Gaming and PingPerfect as well.

Host Havoc also has some of the best performance I've experienced hosting a variety of games, and their support team answered my ticket in a matter of _minutes_.

Still, for those who want to host a small server on a budget, they're probably not the best option due to their minimum monthly fee of $14.

But if you're hosting a larger server, Host Havoc is one of the best choices.

## 7 Days to Die Darkness Falls Server

Darkness Falls is a popular mod for 7 Days to Die, so it's easy to see why you'd want to run it on your server for you and your friends.

Setting up Darkness Falls on a dedicated server is a bit tricky if you're running the server on your own computer. [This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/7daystodie/comments/fpq557/dedicated_a18_server_running_darkness_falls_mod/){: target="\_blank"} goes into detail about setting up the Darkness Falls mod on your PC for Alpha 18.

It's much easier to setup a Darkness Falls modded server with one of the hosting companies above. They have one click mod installs and 24/7 support staff to help you create the server.

## 7 Days to Die Server Mods

The vanilla 7 Days to Die game is pretty awesome, but what would any PC game be without its modding community?

7 Days to Die has a crapload of awesome mods that keep things interesting, like True Survival, Ravenhearst, and Darkness falls.

Check out [this list of the top 10 mods for 7 Days to Die](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/7-days-to-die-best-mods){: target="\_blank"} if you're interested - all of the 7 Days to Die server hosts on our list support mods!

## People Also Ask

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions I receive about 7 Days to Die server hosting:

### Does 7 Days to Die Have Servers?

There are public servers for 7 Days to Die that you can join, but they're not officially hosted by Valve or another company. All of the 7 Days to Die servers are run by people like you and me who set them up on their own and open the servers to the public.

### Why is 7 Days to Die So Laggy?

Assuming you meet the minimum requirements for the game, it could be the server you're playing on. Some server hosts don't use the best hardware or try to host the game themselves, both of which are recipes for disaster.

Try leaving the server and joining another one to test the performance. The game is also still in Alpha (somehow) which could be to blame for poor performance optimization.

### How Do You Join a Game in 7 Days to Die?

Joining a game in 7 Days to Die is pretty easy. At the home screen, click 'Connect to Server' and you'll be brought to the server browser menu. From there, you can select from a standard server (best for noobs), modded servers, and peer to peer games (less people than server games).

### How Many Players is 7 Days to Die?

7 Days to Die online co-op has a maximum supported player count of eight, but if you host your own server you can host as many players as you want (GTX Gaming has servers up to 120 people).

### Can You Play 7 Days to Die Solo?

7 Days to Die has a single player mode called Survival SP (Single Player). It's a single player game that's closed off from public access and can only played by a single person.

{% include games.html %}

## Final Word

7 Days to Die is an awesome game that's even better with friends. Setting up your own server is an option for those on a tight budget, but renting a server is usually a better choice.

Better performance, 24/7 uptime, and a dedicated support staff are all great reasons to rent from a hosting company.

If you have any questions, I'd love to hear from you - shoot me an email [here](/contact/) and I'll get back to you ASAP!
