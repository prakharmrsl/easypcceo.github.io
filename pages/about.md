## Jacob Tuwiner - Owner & Founder 

My name is [Jacob Tuwiner](https://www.jacobtuwiner.com/). I'm the owner and creator of Easy PC, a site designed to help the new guy in the computer space. Whether you want to build your first gaming PC or your first cryptocurrency mining rig, I've got you covered.   

I used to be a console gamer from age 9, until I played on my friend's gaming PC for the first time. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Battlefield 4 in true 1080p resolution with ultra settings, 60 FPS. I also loved raiding someone's base in Rust which is still my favorite game to this day! From that moment on I knew I had to build a gaming PC.

I used some of my bar mitzvah money to build my first gaming PC. I researched which components would best fit my budget and watched tons of videos on YouTube about PC building. 

Then the day arrived. All of my parts finally came in the mail and I assembled my first PC.

Then I turned it on. Nothing happened.

I checked everything and tried again. Nothing.

Then I looked two more times and realized I made a novice mistake. I didn't connect the CPU power cable!

I turned it on again. Bam! Everything was working properly. From that moment on I was a member of the PC gaming community. 

I first made the [Easy PC YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuPW6x4ZBXR06cjmf1wOS2g){:target="_blank"} and eventually this website in order to help those just starting out. Trust me, it's a lot easier than it seems! The hardest part is getting started, and it's all down hill from there.

### My Experience Building Computers 

I've been building computers for more than 8 years now (I started when I was 12 years old). I used to tear down my PC every week and put it back together for fun (yeah, I had no life). 

Now I can configure a PC in less than 30 minutes, blind folded with my hands behind my back. Okay, not really, but I can build a PC in just about 30 minutes. 

I'm always looking at the latest hardware deals and staying up to date with the newest PC hardware. 

With more than 8 years of PC building experience under my belt and many more to come, I've created Easy PC to share my expertise with people like you! 

### My Current PC Specs

If you're curious about what I'm running in my rig, I'm going to list my specs down below. 

I don't really feel the need to run my games in 1440p or 4K resolution. I'd rather save the money and play in 1080p with medium-high settings with 60+ FPS. That being said, here are my specs: 

* **CPU:** Ryzen 3 1200 Overclocked to 4.0 GHz
* **Motherboard:** ASRock AB350M 
* **RAM:** 2x4GB DDR4 2400 MHz G.Skill Ripjaws V Series
* **Storage:** 240 GB SSD, 120GB SSD, 1TB 7200RPM Hard Drive
* **Graphics Card:** GeForce GTX 1060 3GB 
* **Case**: NZXT Phantom with Blue LEDs
* **PSU:** Corsair 500 Watt Power Supply 

It's not the most expensive build in the world, but it definitely suits my purposes well.

The Man? The Myth? The Legend?

Hey there! I’m Jordyn Hamilton, a writer and editor for Easy PC. The one-stop-shop for brand new PC builders, gamers, and enthusiasts alike.

I got my start in the PC community around 2017 when a good friend of mine convinced me to build a gaming computer after he’d done the same. I had always thought about getting into PC gaming since the most I’d experienced up to that point was 30fps Minecraft on my old HP laptop. 

So the concept of running any games at a good framerate, and for a good price, was gorgeous to me. Around that time, I got a job editing for an online blog. I made around $1,400 working on it and I threw about $500 of that into my brand new PC build. 

Mind you, I did not know anything about computers prior to this and I did not seek out any help in choosing parts (like I should have). In the end, my first build looked a little something like: FX 6300, RX 560 4GB, random $10 aftermarket CPU cooler, just to name a few hiccups. 

That build served me well for a couple of months until I got bored with it and wanted to upgrade. What I did was sell the parts for a little less than I paid, then I used the money to buy more used parts so I could build two more computers. Then I sold those and repeated the process until I had around $1,000.

Fast forward to February 2018. At this point component prices were horrible but I want my PC now, so I charged in full of zeal with $1,000 to build the best I could, and that build fuels me to this day. Though, at this point, I think I’ve sunk another $100 or so into it.

### My Current PC Specs

While my rig isn’t the greatest by any means, it’s what I could get at the time with the knowledge I had at the time.

* **CPU:** Ryzen 5 2600 Overclocked to 4.05GHz
* **Motherboard:** MSI B350 PC MATE 
* **RAM:** PNY Anarchy 2x8GB 2400MHz Overclocked to 3133MHz
* **Storage:** 2TB 7200RPM HDD, 500GB 7200RPM HDD, 240GB SATA SSD, 32GB M.2 SSD
* **Graphics Card:** GeForce GTX 980 G1 Gaming  
* **Case**: DIYPC VisionII-Bl Black
* **PSU:** Corsair RM650x 650W PSU

## Diego Riitano - Writer
<img class="lazyload circle img-right img-small" alt="diego riitano" data-src="/img/profile/diego.jpg">

My name is Diego Riitano. I am a writer and editor here at Easy PC. I enjoy creating PC and gaming content that’s easy for a newcomer to understand.

I entered the PC world for the first time the summer before my freshman year of high school. I remember playing games on my cheap laptop and being unsatisfied with the low frame rates and disappointed graphics.

After doing some research, I realized the best way to get the performance I wanted was to pick my own components and build a PC myself. 

I was very intimidated at the prospect of building my own computer, but after seeing many guides online, I thought I should make the leap.

After multiple weeks of researching the best components, I was finally ready to order. The day my parts arrived I was incredibly excited to finally build it. Being a total novice, it took me around 3 hours to get it all together.

Taking it slow and steady, I managed to get my PC built without any major problems. When it finally booted up, I was ecstatic to start playing games. Finally I could play AAA titles with max settings and still get a buttery smooth 60+ FPS.

For the past 6 years since then, I’ve been building computers and learning more about gaming and PCs every day. I like to help those new to the scene since I remember exactly how I felt when I built my first PC.

My Current PC Specs:

Nowadays, my rig isn’t the most powerful, but it definitely suits my purposes well. As long as I can play most games at 1080p with respectable frame rates, I’m satisfied.

* CPU: Intel i7-4790K
* Motherboard: MSI Z97 PC Mate
* RAM: 4x4GB DDR3 1600 MHz
* Storage: 240 GB SSD, 480 GB SSD
* Graphics Card: Radeon R9 290 4 GB
* Case: Sentey Burton Plus 3.0 GS-6510
* PSU: Antec HCG-850M 850 Watt Bronze Plus
