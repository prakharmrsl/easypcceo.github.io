<p>Here’s the deal:</p>

<p>You want to build a gaming PC that you’re actually <em>proud of</em>. That means you can’t have your cables in a big jumbled mess.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve created this guide - the first case I ever bought had terrible cable management, and I want to help you avoid the same mistake.</p>

<p>Today, we’re taking a look at three of the best pc cases for cable management on the market today.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cable-management">What is Cable Management?</h2>

<p>Cable management in a nutshell is organizing them in a way that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>For example, on our page about <a href="/pc-cases/does-cable-management-matter/">cable management and airflow</a> we talk about whether or not cable management matters and show some examples of good cable management vs bad cable management.</p>

<div class="quote-box">
	<p>If your cables are all stuffed in your case, you've got a few problems on your hands. First of all, your cables will obstruct proper airflow. Secondly, anyone who looks in your gaming PC will be horrified by what they see! If you're proud of your PC, keep your cables nice and tidy.</p>
