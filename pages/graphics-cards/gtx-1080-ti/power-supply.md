Your power supply can make or break your PC. 

Grab a power supply with a [wattage](https://www.energuide.be/en/questions-answers/what-do-watt-and-kwh-mean/121/){: target="_blank"} that’s too low? 

You might overdraw power and kill your new power supply, if not your other components as well. 

Buy a power supply with too much wattage? 

You'll needlessly spend extra dollars that you could be allocating towards other aspects of your computer.

If you want the best power supply for the [GTX 1080 Ti](/graphics-cards/gtx-1080-ti/), we recommend the [Corsair RM650x](https://amzn.to/2ocV00Y){: target="_blank"}. It has plenty of power, it's fully modular, and its 80+ Gold certification makes it incredibly power efficient.

If you’ve decided to opt for a fully-modular power supply for whatever reason, it’s hard to go wrong with Corsair’s RMx series of PSUs.

The RM650x 650W PSU provides enough power for most, if not all, 1080 Ti-based systems. 

If that’s not the case for you, however, feel free to opt for the [RM750x](https://amzn.to/2o6PmgF){: target="_blank"} or [RM850x](https://amzn.to/2oYIC4X){: target="_blank"} if you really think you need it.

650 watts is most plenty for any system – even with a 1080 Ti – and can be overkill at times. 

At least you’ll have a bit of overclocking headroom and won’t have to worry about it dying anytime soon, and hey those cable braids are pretty sexy to boot.

Swooping in for our best semi-modular spot is actually a PSU that flies pretty low under the radar, the Raidmax Scorpio 535W.  

I’ve actually had the chance to get hands-on experience with the Scorpio being that it was my main power supply for almost 2 years, and I still use it to this day for component testing. 

Let me tell you, this thing can take a beating.

Not only does this bad boy sport a whole 535W (enough for most systems), the sheer amount of times this thing has been dropped or had things dropped on it is staggering, and it’s still chugging on.

That doesn’t mean go throw it down the stairs though. 

Please don’t do that...

Going for a budget build and don’t need the extra baggage? The Seasonic S12II 450 80+ Bronze comes to the rescue!

Coming in at only $45USD (that’s 10 watts per dollar!) the Seasonic S12II offers almost unrivaled reliability at a compelling price point, and 430 watts is enough for any budget or even mid-range build.

The 80+ Bronze efficiency rating may not be the greatest of all but you’ve got to cut some corners somewhere, and they sure don’t cut the corner of quality. 

Seasonic is so confident in the quality of this power supply that it includes a whole 5 year warranty! Geez.

**But here's the thing:**

If you're buying a power supply for a GTX 1080 Ti, don't buy a non-modular model. 

A 1080 Ti is a top tier graphics card, one that's meant to be paired with a top-tier power supply like one of the two mentioned above.  

That being said, you don't *need* a modular power supply, so it's really up to you. 

But if I was building a gaming PC with a 1080 Ti, I'd be going fully modular and 80+ Gold certified all the way!

## Powering a GTX 1080 Ti Crypto Mining Rig
![gtx 1080 ti mining rig](/img/gpu/1080ti/power-supply/1080-ti-mining-rig.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

In some cases, you may be looking to use your 1080 Ti for [cryptocurrency mining](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cryptocurrency-mining.html){: target="_blank"} instead and don’t worry we’ve got you covered with the EVGA Supernova 1600 T2.

The quality of your power supply when crypto mining is absolutely detrimental to success. 

Just think about how fast you’ll lose money if your PSU dies, for example. So you need something you can rely on and the Supernova T2 series doesn’t disappoint.

At 1600 watts with a mouthwatering 80+ Titanium rating, the 1600 T2 provides plenty of power for your rig and considering the 1080 Ti can hit a power draw upwards of 200 watts you’re gonna need it if you’re running a sizeable rig.

If you are running a smaller rig we suggest opting for the 1000 T2 or the 850 T2 since they provide the same great reliability as the 1600 without the extra wattage or cost.

## Power Supplies: How to Make The Right Choice

Choosing the right power supply can be tricky – luckily, this video is here to help: 

<div class="vid-container">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sThQTgDfjVg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Types of Power Supplies

There are three different types of power supplies:

* Non-modular
* Semi-modular
* Fully modular

Each type has a varying degree of customization in the sense that they have interchangeable cables, and the names pretty much speak for themselves.

### Non-Modular
![non modular power supply example](/img/gpu/1080ti/power-supply/non-modular.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

A non-modular power supply is generally the cheapest out of the three types because of its lack of customizability. 

Non-modular power supplies come with all of their cables attached to the power supply box unable to be removed, unlike the other two types. 

This, of course, means that whatever cables are there is all you have to work with.

One of the other downsides to non-modular power supplies is that since it comes with the cables pre-attached, any extra unused cables are kinda just stuck there and you’ve got to find a way to get them out of the way for cable management. 

Also, many non-modular power supplies don’t come equipped with enough PCIe power cables to power higher-end graphics cards.

A good situation to pick a non-modular power supply would be for a lower budget build, or if you know for sure you have the right cables. 

Luckily, most good and cheap non-modular power supplies fall under the 80+ Bronze efficiency rating which we’ll talk about later.

### Semi-Modular
![semi modular power supply example](/img/gpu/1080ti/power-supply/semi-modular.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

Semi-modular power supplies are like the best of both worlds when it comes to power supplies, they include the main cables that every motherboard and (almost) every graphics card needs. 

This includes the 24-pin ATX power connector for the motherboard, the 4+4-pin CPU power connector, and a 6+2-pin PCIe power connector.

The modular portion comes in with the optional included cables. 

Semi-modular power supplies tend to have 3 optional peripheral slots and a second PCIe power connector slot in case your graphics card needs more than 8-pin power. 

These optional slots can be fitted out with SATA power connectors for HDD and SSD power, or Molex connectors for various power use cases.

Semi-modular power supplies are what we recommend for any build since they’re often cheaper than their fully modular counterparts as you go up the efficiency ladder, while still offering just as much ease of use and reduced cable hassle.

### Fully-Modular
![fully modular power supply example](/img/gpu/1080ti/power-supply/fully-modular.jpg){: .img-right .img-small}

Finally, we reach the fully-modular power supply options.

Fully-modular power supplies are for the user that absolutely needs maximum possible customization because with a fully-modular power supply, you can remove every cable from the power supply as you wish. 

Unfortunately, this does mean that the extra engineering that goes into these power supplies can be explicitly seen in the cost as fully-modular power supplies cost a helluva lot more than the other two types. 

This does come with one added benefit, however, in that the cost also reflects their reliability.

We wrote an awesome guide abou whether or not you need a modular power supply, which you can read by clicking [here](/need-modular-power-supply/). 

## Power Supply Wattage

A power supply’s wattage is fairly self-explanatory. 

Whatever wattage your PSU is rated for, is the maximum power output it can sustain, so don’t go pairing a 250W PSU with a system drawing 300W.

Don’t go thinking you can pair a 400W power supply with a system drawing 400W though, because any fluctuation that might put that power draw above your PSU’s limit can fatally damage your components. 

## Efficiency Rating

The efficiency rating of a power supply is just what the name implies; a rating on how power efficient a power supply is. 

In short, the higher the efficiency rating on your PSU, the more electricity makes it from the wall to your computer as opposed to being lost to heat or other outlets.
